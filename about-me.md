title: About Toni
---
Toni Magni is a biomedical engineer focused on orthodontic software IT infrastructures. Currently employed at tops Software (Atlanta, GA), he serves as co-chair for the ADA Standards Committee for Dental Informatics Working Group 11.6 (Integration of Orthodontic Standards) and Clinical Instructor in the Department of Orthodontics at Case Western Reserve University. A frequent collaborator with various associations and organizations, he has developed Python and JAVA tools to save orthodontic photographs and x-rays, which are available to the community on Github.com (a platform for software developers used to collaborate). Magni promotes interoperability in orthodontic practices by installing DICOM imaging servers and integrating them with existing software.

Toni is fuelled by his passion for eliminating inefficiencies in
the medical field, where software often makes exchanging data unnecessarily difficult. He considers himself a patient, hard-working nerd,
eager to create an infrastructure that software developers, doctors and
patients can use to fully take advantage of current and future technologies. 

Toni believes mindfulness in the workspace is the key to success, a tenet he lives
through his interest in meditation.
