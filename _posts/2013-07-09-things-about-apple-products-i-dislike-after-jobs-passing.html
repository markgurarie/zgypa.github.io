<p>It might be a coincidence, and it might be just the way the mind plays tricks
on me, however, ever since Steve Jobs passed away, i have notices an array of
things which do not work on/with Apple products, and keep not working. I have
the impression that when he was active, problems would still occur, however they
would disappear silently. Now many of them stay... So i wrote this post to see
if this theory i have come up with is really true or not.</p>
