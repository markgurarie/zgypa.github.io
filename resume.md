## Standards Based

In keeping with my commitment to informatics standards, i have decided to present my CV in another standard, the EuropassCV format. The PDF was generated from the
[europass European Union](https://europa.eu/europass/) website and it includes
the CV in Europass XML format. You can extract the XML with `pdfdetach`.
